I'm an IT Data Analytics student at Western Technical College and an Operations Support Specialist at Kwik Trip.  
I love solving problems with data, learning new technologies, and helping improve operations.  

Outside of work, I enjoy singing, performing at Hmong New Year competitions, and collecting Pok√©mon cards!

Hello, my name is Lucas Xiong

I'm an IT Data Analytic student at WTC and I work for Kwik Trip as a Operations Support Specialist. I enjoy learning, being creative, and solving problems. Outside of school and work I love to sing and perform for the Hmong New Years in WI and MN. I also compete in the singing competitions as well. 

I am pursuing data analytics because I'm curious about how information can improve operations and decision making. Working in Operations Support has shown me the impact of good data. I'm detailed orientated, a fast learneer, and I enjoy collaborating to solve problems.

Short term goals:
I would like to compete more at singing competitions,
collect more pokemon cards, and
I would like to finish my first semester at WTC.

Long term goals:
I want to win more than one singing competition,
to graduate, and
a nicer car.
